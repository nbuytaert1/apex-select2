Select2 APEX Plugin
===================

The Select2 plugin is a jQuery based replacement for select lists in Oracle Application Express.
It supports searching, multiselection, tagging, lazy loading and infinite scrolling of results.

##About

The Select2 APEX plugin is based on [Select2](https://select2.github.io/) –
an open-source jQuery plugin that greatly improves the functionality and user-friendliness of regular select lists.
In Oracle Application Express, the Select2 plugin can serve as a replacement for these four standard item types:

* Select List
* Shuttle
* Text Field with autocomplete
* List Manager
